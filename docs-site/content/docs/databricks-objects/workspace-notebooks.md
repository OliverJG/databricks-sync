## Impacted Databricks Resources

The impacted resources for this workspace object are:

1. <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/index.html" target="_blank"> Databricks Workspace Notebooks </a>
2. Databricks Notebook Permissions
3. Databricks Folder Permissions

## References to appropriate REST Apis

1. <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/workspace.html" target="_blank"> Workspace Api </a>: Used
downloading and uploading notebooks via terraform provider
2. <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/permissions.html" target="_blank"> Permissions Api </a>: Used
exporting permissions on notebooks and folders and then applied to target workspace via terraform provider

## Known Limitations

{{< bootstrap-alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text=`Currently there is only one limitation based on the behavior of the provider. The difference is determined by changes in
the source workspace. So everytime you export if it determines a difference in the checksum of the source file it will determine
that as a change. Any changes made or caused in the target workspace will not be tracked unless the file itself is removed.
` >}}


## Permissions Support

All permissions are dependant users and groups being created successfuly if you are exporting [`identity`]({{< relref "workspace-identities.md" >}}).

Currently the following permissions are exported:
1. Permissions directly attached to the notebooks
2. Permissions associated with any of the folders that are being exported. These folder permissions
   have a dependency on at least one notebook in that folder path being created in the workspace so the folder
   can also exist. This dependancy can be identified in the file itself
